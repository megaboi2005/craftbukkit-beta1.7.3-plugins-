# craftbukkit-beta1.7.3-plugins-
My a$$ plugins, all in one place , be free to steal for yourself

## how 2 build
1. make sure you have java 8 installed on the system PATH variable for windows or default java on linux.
2. download craftbukkit, I suggest using the fork https://github.com/canyonmodded/canyon because its super lightweight
3. place the .jar of craftbukkit in the lib directory in the root folder of the Main.java
4. run the build.bat or build.sh files to compile
5. enjoy :D
